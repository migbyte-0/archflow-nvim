# Why ArchFlow?
Flutter projects often require repetitive setup for new features, including creating folder structures and wiring up state management. ArchFlow.nvim simplifies this process by automating it, allowing you to focus on building your app instead of managing boilerplate.

## Key Benefits:
- **Save Time:** Instantly set up folders and files for your architecture.
- **Consistency:** Standardize the structure across your Flutter project.
- **Flexible State Management:** Supports multiple state management libraries.
- **Ease of Use:** Quickly navigate and manage created features.

---

# Features
## **Architecture Selection**
Generate feature structures for the most common architectures:
   - `MVC`  
   - `MVVM`  
   - `Clean Architecture`

## **State Management Integration**
Supports the following state management libraries:
   - **Provider**
   - **Riverpod**
   - **BLoC**
   - **Cubit**
   - **GetX**

## **Customizable Templates**
Modify or extend boilerplate code for any architecture or state management.

## **Quick Navigation**
Integrated file navigator for accessing recently created features.

# Installation

Install using **lazy.nvim** or your preferred plugin manager:

```lua
{
  "migbyte-0/archflow.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("archflow").setup()
  end,
}
```

---

# Usage

1. Run `:ArchFlowGenerate` or use the default keybinding `<leader>af`.
2. Select the desired architecture (`MVC`, `MVVM`, or `Clean Architecture`).
3. Choose your state management library (`Provider`, `Riverpod`, etc.).
4. Enter the feature name.
5. Watch ArchFlow.nvim create the feature's folder structure and files in seconds!

Example:

```lua
// Select "Clean Architecture" and "BLoC":
// Folder structure auto-generated for 'Authentication':
// - data/
// - domain/
// - presentation/
```

---

# Configuration

Customize the plugin in your Neovim configuration:

```lua
require("archflow").setup({
  keybinding = "<leader>af",  -- Default keybinding
  debug = false,             -- Enable debug logs
})
```

---

# Dependencies

1. **Neovim** (>= 0.8.0)  
2. **Flutter SDK**

---

# Advanced Topics

### Custom Architecture Templates

Easily extend or modify boilerplate templates by editing the files under `lua/archflow/templates`. Use this feature to add new logic, include additional files, or support custom state management.

### State Management Integration

ArchFlow automatically generates state management boilerplate files for your chosen library:
- **Provider:** `ChangeNotifier` classes.
- **Riverpod:** `StateNotifier` or `Provider` setup.
- **BLoC/Cubit:** Events, states, and BLoC/Cubit files.
- **GetX:** Controllers and reactive state management logic.
